###Tidy Data
Combining 
1. Date and Time Conversion: It converts date and time columns into a single DateTime column, computes hours since midnight, and scales the time of day. Filtering: It filters out surveys conducted before a specific cutoff date (May 13th, 2024).Survey Labeling: It assigns survey labels based on the chronological order within each pointId2.Data Cleaning: It converts 'FLUSHED' values in the 'Time of 1st Detection' column to -1 so the column is read as an integer string.
2. Merge the surveyLevel (bird data) and pointLevel (vegetation data) together by pointId2. Each point had a unique pointId2 that links bird and vegetation data together.
3. Add the individual level species data to the merged data from step 1. merge them by dataSheetNum, which links the Survey Level to individual level. 

```{r}
# Convert date and time columns to single Date Time Column

# Step 1: Convert Date from character to Date format
surveys$date <- as.Date(surveys$date, format = "%d %b %Y")
 
# Convert startTime to time-only format and compute hours since midnight
surveys <- surveys %>%
  mutate(
    timeOnly = format(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), "%H:%M:%S"),
    hrsSinceMidnight = hour(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) +
      minute(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) / 60 +
      second(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) / 3600,
    scaledTimeOfDay = scale(hrsSinceMidnight, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)[,1] # Extract numeric value
  )
 
# Filter out surveys before the breeding season cutoff (May 13th, 2024)
cutoff_date <- as.POSIXct("2024-05-13", format = "%Y-%m-%d") # Set cutoff date
surveys <- surveys %>% filter(date > cutoff_date)  # Keep only surveys after the cutoff
 
# Filter the data frame to only include rows where DateTime is later than May 13th, 2024
surveys <- surveys %>%
  filter(date > cutoff_date)

 
# Create a 'DayOfYear' column in surveys for later use because time objects don't work in occu() function
surveys$DayOfYear <- yday(surveys$date)
#-------------------------------------------------

#Step 2: Assign survey labels based on the chronological order within each pointId2 (i.e. survey1, survey2, survey3, & survey4)**

surveys$survey <- NA  # Initialize a 'survey' column
surveys <- surveys %>%
  group_by(pointId2) %>%  # Group by 'pointId2'
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>%  # Sort each group by 'Datetime' ##### <---- NEED TO RE-CREATE A DATETIME OBJECT PRIOR TO THIS
  mutate(survey = paste0("survey", row_number())) %>%  # Assign survey labels
  ungroup()  # Ungroup the data

#-------------------------------------------------------------
#Step 3: Assign -1 to 'FLUSHED' values in 'Time of 1st Detection' to allow for conversion to numeric data
birds$timeOfFirstDet[birds$timeOfFirstDet == "FLUSHED"] <- -1
birds$timeOfFirstDet <- as.integer(birds$timeOfFirstDet)  # Convert to integer
class(birds$timeOfFirstDet)  # Check the class of the column
table(birds$timeOfFirstDet)  # View frequency table of values

```

#Merge pointLevel covariates into surveyLevel by matching column 'pointId2'
merged_data <- surveys %>%
  left_join(points, by = "pointId2")  # Perform a left join to preserve all rows in surveyLevel
  #this is saying merge surveyLevel with PointLevel so data is set up surveyLevel|pointLevel and merged from pointId2 on

Based on the literature and 2024 Point Counts, Prairie Warblers are a bird who share similar ecological niches as Bachman's sparrow and Northern Bobwhite, and are in low to moderate numbers on Perdido River and Fred T. Simpson wildlife management areas (WMA). Because only one Bachman's sparrow was found in Fred T. Simpson WMA, we are choosing to conduct our social information experiment, using broadcast and playback recording devices, in Perdido River WMA where the sample size was larger (n=13).

## Data Frame for later quality check

**Create a Data Frame to Review Occupancy Output**

```{r}
# qc_df = filtered_data
 
# Remove rows where all three distance columns are NA for the species of interest ('NOBO')
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  filter(!(is.na(dist0_4) & is.na(dist4_8) & is.na(dist8_12) & filtered_data$species == "NOBO"))
 
# Data Frame for later quality check
# qc_df2 = filtered_data
 
# Remove rows where 'Probable MisID' column has a value of 1 (indicating a misidentification)
filtered_data <- filtered_data[filtered_data$probableMisId == 0, ]
 
# Create prawPresence column
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(pointId2) %>%
  mutate(prawPresence = ifelse(any(species == "PRAW"), 1, 0)) %>% # can substitute any species here
  ungroup()

# Move prawPresence to the 35th column
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  relocate(prawPresence, .before = 35) # makes it easier to subset point-level covariates later


# Step 1: Identify species to include (excluding those starting with "XX")
valid_species <- filtered_data %>%
  filter(!str_starts(species, "XX")) %>% #if character string starts with XX, remove these
  pull(species) %>%
  unique()
 
# Step 2: Loop over each species and create presence columns
for (sp in valid_species) {
  col_name <- paste0(sp, "Presence")  # Generate dynamic column name
  filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
    group_by(pointId2) %>%
    mutate(!!col_name := ifelse(any(species == sp), 1, 0)) %>%
    ungroup()
}
 
# Step 3: Move new presence columns to start at the 35th position
presence_cols <- grep("Presence$", colnames(filtered_data), value = TRUE)  # Identify new presence columns
other_cols <- setdiff(colnames(filtered_data), presence_cols)  # Other columns
 
#Step 4: Reorder dataframe: Keep original columns, but insert presence columns at position 35
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  select(all_of(other_cols[1:34]), all_of(presence_cols), all_of(other_cols[35:length(other_cols)]))
```


###NOBO Specific Model

**Filter data to include only NOBO observations** 
```{r}
filtered_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(dataSheetNum) %>%
  filter(if (any(species == "NOBO")) {
    species == "NOBO"
  } else {
    row_number() == 1  # Keep at least one row per group
  }) %>%
  ungroup()
```

 
## Occupancy Model Preparation and Output
```{r}

obsCovs_list <- list()
for (covariate in obs_covariate_names) {
  wide_df <- filtered_data %>%
    select(pointId2, survey, all_of(covariate)) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = survey, values_from = all_of(covariate), values_fill = setNames(list(NA), covariate)) %>%
    as.data.frame()
  rownames(wide_df) <- paste("pointId2", wide_df$pointId2, sep = "")  # Set rownames
  obsCovs_list[[covariate]] <- wide_df[, -1]  # Remove 'pointId2' column
}
 
# Create 'unmarkedFrameOccu' object for occupancy modeling
unmarked_occu_data <- unmarkedFrameOccu(y = pa_df, siteCovs = point_covs, obsCovs = obsCovs_list)
 
# Fit a single occupancy model for 'NOBO' species (entire dataset)
NOBO_model <- occu(~ observer + scaledTimeOfDay ~ landcover, data = unmarked_occu_data) #looking at landcover effects on NOBO presence

# Results of NOBO Occupancy Model by Landcover Type 

For all 9 WMAs: The model shows that across all WMAs, the following have a positive effect on NOBO presence, but none of them are significant and standard error is high:
- Open Areas (OP)
- Even-Aged Pine (EAP)
- Mixed Pine Hardwood (MPH)

For Perdidio River: The model shows that the intercept here, being Even-Aged Pine, has a positive effect on occupancy of Northern Bobwhite (2.03 on logit-scale). In other words, Northern Bobwhite have an 88.4% chance of occupying that habitat type. This positive effect is insignificant (p-value: 0.101). However, this model can still be used in decision making for point placement of playback and recording devices in suitable habitat for NOBO.

# Results of NOBO Occupancy Model by Praire Warbler and Bachman's Sparrow Presence 
Both Praire warblers and Bachman's sparrows have a positive effect on occurpancy by northern bobwhite, but the values are not statistically significant and the standard error is very high for Bachman's sparrow. Bachman's sparrow have a very low sample size (n=13) and this is likely contributing to the results of the model.
