###Tidy Data
Combining 
1. Date and Time Conversion: It converts date and time columns into a single DateTime column, computes hours since midnight, and scales the time of day. Filtering: It filters out surveys conducted before a specific cutoff date (May 13th, 2024).Survey Labeling: It assigns survey labels based on the chronological order within each pointId2.Data Cleaning: It converts 'FLUSHED' values in the 'Time of 1st Detection' column to -1 so the column is read as an integer string.
2. Merge the surveyLevel (bird data) and pointLevel (vegetation data) together by pointId2. Each point had a unique pointId2 that links bird and vegetation data together.
3. Add the individual level species data to the merged data from step 1. merge them by dataSheetNum, which links the Survey Level to individual level. 

```{r}
# Convert date and time columns to single Date Time Column

# Step 1: Convert Date from character to Date format
surveys$date <- as.Date(surveys$date, format = "%d %b %Y")
 
# Convert startTime to time-only format and compute hours since midnight
surveys <- surveys %>%
  mutate(
    timeOnly = format(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), "%H:%M:%S"),
    hrsSinceMidnight = hour(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) +
      minute(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) / 60 +
      second(as.POSIXct(startTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")) / 3600,
    scaledTimeOfDay = scale(hrsSinceMidnight, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)[,1] # Extract numeric value
  )
 
# Filter out surveys before the breeding season cutoff (May 13th, 2024)
cutoff_date <- as.POSIXct("2024-05-13", format = "%Y-%m-%d") # Set cutoff date
surveys <- surveys %>% filter(date > cutoff_date)  # Keep only surveys after the cutoff
 
# Filter the data frame to only include rows where DateTime is later than May 13th, 2024
surveys <- surveys %>%
  filter(date > cutoff_date)

 
# Create a 'DayOfYear' column in surveys for later use because time objects don't work in occu() function
surveys$DayOfYear <- yday(surveys$date)
#-------------------------------------------------

#Step 2: Assign survey labels based on the chronological order within each pointId2 (i.e. survey1, survey2, survey3, & survey4)**

surveys$survey <- NA  # Initialize a 'survey' column
surveys <- surveys %>%
  group_by(pointId2) %>%  # Group by 'pointId2'
  arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %>%  # Sort each group by 'Datetime' ##### <---- NEED TO RE-CREATE A DATETIME OBJECT PRIOR TO THIS
  mutate(survey = paste0("survey", row_number())) %>%  # Assign survey labels
  ungroup()  # Ungroup the data

#-------------------------------------------------------------
#Step 3: Assign -1 to 'FLUSHED' values in 'Time of 1st Detection' to allow for conversion to numeric data
birds$timeOfFirstDet[birds$timeOfFirstDet == "FLUSHED"] <- -1
birds$timeOfFirstDet <- as.integer(birds$timeOfFirstDet)  # Convert to integer
class(birds$timeOfFirstDet)  # Check the class of the column
table(birds$timeOfFirstDet)  # View frequency table of values

```


```{r}
#Merge pointLevel covariates into surveyLevel by matching column 'pointId2'
merged_data <- surveys %>%
  left_join(points, by = "pointId2")  # Perform a left join to preserve all rows in surveyLevel
  #this is saying merge surveyLevel with PointLevel so data is set up surveyLevel|pointLevel and merged from pointId2 on 

#Merge individualLevel data into merged_data by matching on 'dataSheetNum'
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  left_join(individuals, by = "dataSheetNum") #Perform a left join to preserve all rows in surveyLevel
